## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-19 14:28 → app/(tabs)/index.tsx is a 41KB+ God component; UserDataContext.refresh() has no concurrency guard; zero test infrastructure

Three structural concerns: (1) `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` exceeds 41KB — the primary generate screen handles ingredient input, category browsing, pantry sync, recipe generation, premium gating, save-to-list modal, announcement banners, loading states, and multi-step animation all in a single file. No sub-components are extracted. Any change to ingredient UI risks breaking recipe generation logic. (2) `UserDataContext.refresh()` has no in-flight guard — if auth change and AppState foreground fire within the same tick (possible on app restore), two identical sets of four API calls run in parallel. The second set's results overwrite the first's with no error. (3) `package.json` `devDependencies` contains only `@types/react`, `react-native-svg-transformer`, and `typescript`. No `jest`, `vitest`, `@testing-library/react-native`, or test script exists.
## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-15 09:12 → PM2 helpers are duplicated across chat.ts and slack-bot.ts; OG image generation is inlined in recipes.ts; no tests exist

Three structural concerns: (1) `getPm2Status()`, `getRecentLogs()`, and `getMetricsSummary()` are duplicated across `src/routes/chat.ts` and `src/slack-bot.ts` with identical implementations — two codepaths that will diverge on any PM2 format change. (2) OG image generation (~100 lines, lines 17–144 of recipes.ts) is inlined in the routes file alongside the `emojiCache` Map and `logoBuffer` globals — it belongs in `src/services/og-image.ts`. (3) No test files exist anywhere in the project: no `*.test.ts`, no `jest.config.*`, no `vitest.config.*`, and no test dependencies in `package.json`. The `pluralStem` pantry-matching function, `extractFoodEmoji` pipeline, and Apple JWT verification are all business-critical paths running in production with zero automated coverage.
## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-14 23:03 → cross-provider pantry alignment analysis to validate premium upsell

`logs/recipe-metrics.csv` captures `requestedProvider`, `usedProvider`, `pantryPct`, `groceryPct`, `responseMs`, and `style` for every generation. An analysis grouping by `usedProvider` (ollama vs claude) would reveal:
1. Which provider produces higher pantry alignment (does Claude produce recipes that use more of the selected ingredients?)
2. Response time distribution per provider (Ollama is local — does latency differ meaningfully?)
3. Fallback rate (`fallback=true` rows) — how often does Claude fail and fall through?

This directly informs whether the premium Claude tier delivers measurable recipe quality improvement over the free Ollama tier, which is the core value proposition for monetisation.
## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-13 18:11 → PM2/log logic duplicated across three files; insights bypasses AIProvider abstraction

The logic for reading PM2 process status, recent logs, and today's CSV metrics is duplicated across `src/digest.ts`, `src/slack-bot.ts`, and `src/routes/chat.ts` — three separate implementations that will diverge on any change to PM2's output format. `src/services/ai/insights.ts` hardcodes Ollama for suggestion generation, ignoring the `AIProvider` abstraction used everywhere else; if Ollama is down, suggestions silently degrade to templated fallback strings with no indication to the user. `src/services/ai/provider.ts` at 500+ lines mixes emoji keyword tables, region mappings, and prompt builder functions — unrelated concerns in one file. `GET /recipes` has no pagination, creating a latency ceiling as user recipe counts grow.
## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-13 17:04 → Discover threshold is pantry-size-sensitive; responseMs includes queue wait; continent is random for Ollama

**1. Discover `groceryPct >= 20` threshold is pantry-size-sensitive.**
`GET /recipes/discover` filters to `groceryPct >= 20` (`src/routes/recipes.ts:687`), where `groceryPct = matchCount / recipeIngredientCount * 100`. For a user with 1 pantry item, any recipe using that item where the recipe has ≤5 ingredients qualifies (20%+). For a user with 30 items, almost any shared recipe qualifies. The threshold doesn't account for pantry size, making the feed experience inconsistent across user types.

**2. `responseMs` includes Ollama queue wait time.**
In `src/routes/recipes.ts:229-250`, `genStart = Date.now()` is set before `ollama.generateRecipe()` is called. The `OllamaProvider` serializes requests, so `responseMs` for queued requests includes the time spent waiting for the previous request to complete. P95 latency in the digest is therefore inflated when multiple users generate simultaneously.

**3. Continent assignment is random for Ollama, preference-weighted for Claude.**
`OllamaProvider._generate` calls `pickRegion()` with no args — fully random from all 71 country/continent pairs. `ClaudeProvider.generateRecipe` calls `pickRegion(request.continentPreferences)` filtered to user preferences. The `continent` field stored on Recipe therefore reflects the user's preferences only for Claude recipes, making continent-based analysis in insights and discover feed inconsistent across providers.

**4. Insight weekly cooldown is Redis-resident, not DB-resident.**
The `insights:cooldown:{userId}` key in Redis is lost on Redis restart. A Redis restart could trigger simultaneous insight analysis for all active users, producing a burst of Ollama calls.
## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-09 18:16 â†’ Three Node.js processes (API + digest + slack-bot) share one PostgreSQL instance with unconfigured connection pools; no test suite means every deploy is production-first validation; shared router instances undermine API versioning

**Multi-process PostgreSQL connection pool contention:**
- `src/index.ts` (main API), `src/digest.ts`, and `src/slack-bot.ts` each instantiate their own `PrismaClient` with no explicit `connection_limit`. Prisma's default connection pool is `min(num_cpus * 2 + 1, 10)` per client instance. Three processes on the same Mac mini M4 (8 CPUs) each holding up to 17 connections = up to 51 concurrent connections to one PostgreSQL instance. Under simultaneous digest cron execution + active user traffic + slack-bot DB queries, this pool contention will surface as `P2024` (connection pool timeout) errors before the Mac mini saturates CPU or RAM.

**Zero tests = production is the test environment:**
- No test suite exists (no test files, no test runner config, no CI test step). Every code change â€” including the 5 bug fixes in the 1-1-1 round â€” was validated entirely by running in production and observing behaviour or user reports. There is no regression harness. A new developer fixing one bug cannot verify they haven't introduced another. This is the single largest architectural risk for the codebase at any scale.

**Shared router instances make versioning illusory:**
- Both `/api/recipes` and `/1-1-1/api/recipes` mount the same `router` instance from `src/routes/recipes.ts`. A bug fix in recipes.ts changes the behaviour of both the versioned and unversioned paths simultaneously. The versioning prefix communicates API stability to clients but provides no actual isolation â€” it is a naming convention, not an architectural boundary.

## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-09 18:03 â†’ Synchronous CPU work in request path (canvas OG image, pluralStem matching) blocks event loop; no correlation IDs; recipes.ts doing too many jobs; AI service has no circuit breaker

**Synchronous CPU work blocks the event loop:**
- `@napi-rs/canvas` OG image generation runs synchronously in the recipe save request handler. Canvas is CPU-bound; on the Mac mini M4 with a single Node.js thread, a slow canvas render (e.g., complex font layout) blocks all other requests for its duration. At scale, this is the primary throughput bottleneck.
- `pluralStem()` loop in `cookRecords.ts` iterates over all recipe ingredients Ã— all pantry items per cook record creation â€” O(nÃ—m) per request. For a recipe with 20 ingredients and a user with 50 pantry items, this is 1,000 string comparisons on every cook start.

**No correlation / request IDs:**
- HTTP request logs contain userId and path but no per-request UUID. When debugging a failure that spans rate-limit check â†’ AI call â†’ DB write â†’ OG image â†’ YouTube lookup, log lines cannot be unambiguously correlated without matching timestamps manually. Any concurrent requests by the same user create ambiguous log sequences.

**recipes.ts handles too many concerns:**
- Recipe generation, OG image creation, YouTube search, pantry matching, insight triggering, rate limiting, and CRUD are all in one route file. This creates high coupling: adding a feature to recipe generation risks breaking OG image logic, pantry matching, or insight analysis in the same file. Splitting into services (recipe generation, media, analytics) would isolate change risk.

**AI service has no circuit breaker:**
- `getAIProvider()` calls the AI backend (Ollama/OpenAI/Claude) with no circuit breaker, timeout, or retry limit at the service layer. If Ollama becomes unresponsive (not down, just slow), all recipe generation requests hang indefinitely. Node.js has a default socket timeout of ~2 minutes â€” users wait that long before seeing an error.

**No staging / preview environment documented:**
- All deployment docs reference the Mac mini M4 production instance. There is no documented staging environment. Code changes go straight to production, with no pre-production validation layer.
## ISSUE:analysis 2026-06-07 16:30 â†’ No test suite; monolithic route files; AI insight trigger unknown; no DB connection pooling config; legacy routes create maintenance debt

**No tests:**
- Zero test files found in the repo. No unit, integration, or e2e tests. For a production app handling user data, auth flows, and AI-generated content, this is the single largest quality risk. Any refactor or migration is untested.

**Monolithic route files:**
- `src/routes/recipes.ts` contains OG image generation, YouTube search, AI recipe generation, pantry matching, insight analysis triggering, rate limiting, and CRUD â€” all in one file. This is significant complexity in a single module; any change to recipe generation risks breaking unrelated features.

**AI insight trigger unknown:**
- `runInsightAnalysis()` is imported in recipes.ts but not obviously triggered on a fixed event. If it is conditionally called deep in recipe generation logic, it may fire unpredictably. No cron, no queue, no explicit trigger point visible at the route level.

**Prisma without explicit connection pool config:**
- `src/lib/prisma.ts` instantiates PrismaClient with no `datasourceUrl` override or connection pool tuning. Under concurrent recipe generation (each hitting DB for user lookup, rate limit check, recipe save, insight save, OG image save), connection exhaustion is possible on a single Mac mini.

**Legacy route maintenance debt:**
- Both versioned (`/1-1-1/`) and unversioned routes mount the same router instances â€” any bug or behavior change in a shared router affects both API versions simultaneously, which undermines the point of versioning.

**No request ID / correlation ID:**
- Logs use `userId` but no per-request ID. Debugging a multi-step failure (auth â†’ rate check â†’ AI â†’ DB write â†’ OG image â†’ YouTube) across log lines requires manual timestamp correlation.

The web app has no visible analytics (no GTM, GA, Plausible, Fathom) and no error tracking (no Sentry, no Cloudflare Workers logging hooks). There is no way to know how many users reach the SharedRecipe page, how many see errors, or how the Home page performs. Additionally, `global.css` defines `--font-body: 'Americana', sans-serif` and `--font-display: 'Americana', serif` — both use the same custom font but with opposite generic fallbacks. If `Americana.otf` fails to load, body text renders in a sans-serif and display text in a serif, producing visually inconsistent typography.
