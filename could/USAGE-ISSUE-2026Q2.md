## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-19 14:28 → UserDataContext.refresh() fires 4 API calls on auth change AND on every app foreground with no deduplication; recipeAPI.getMyRecipes() fetches full payloads just for a count

Two performance concerns: (1) `UserDataContext.refresh()` issues four parallel requests (`getPreferences`, `getUsage`, `pantryAPI.getAll`, `recipeAPI.getMyRecipes`) on every `isAuthenticated` change AND on every `AppState 'active'` event (via the second `useEffect`). If the user locks and unlocks their phone, all four calls fire. No debounce, no flag guard against concurrent in-flight calls, no cache TTL. (2) `recipeAPI.getMyRecipes()` (`GET /recipes`) returns up to 500 full recipe objects including `ingredients[]`, `steps[]`, and `pantryUsed[]` arrays — several MB of JSON — just to compute `setRecipeCount(recipes.length)`. A `/recipes/count` endpoint or a `_count` select would reduce this to a single integer.
## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-15 09:12 → GET /recipes fetches up to 500 full recipe objects with no cursor pagination; emojiCache has no size bound

`src/routes/recipes.ts` line 562–587: `prisma.recipe.findMany` with `take: 500` and no cursor pagination. Each row includes `ingredients` (string[]), `steps` (string[]), `pantryUsed` (string[]) — the full recipe payload. For a user with 400+ saved recipes, this single query returns several MB of JSON on every app load. There is no incremental loading. Combined with the `savedListItems: { select: { listId: true } }` join, this is an N-row lateral join. As usage grows, this endpoint will dominate response latency. Secondary: `emojiCache` Map (line 18) accumulates Twemoji PNG buffers (~3–8 KB each) indefinitely per process lifetime with no eviction — a minor but real memory growth vector over days.
## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-14 23:03 → recipe-metrics.csv is an unbounded flat file with no query layer

`logs/recipe-metrics.csv` is appended on every generation call (`src/routes/recipes.ts:844`). It has no rotation, no size limit, and no query interface. The file lives on the Mac mini M4 filesystem — a disk-full event would silently drop all future metrics writes (the catch block only logs a warning).

Migrating to a `RecipeMetric` Postgres table via Prisma would: enable SQL queries over generation history, tie into the existing backup story, and surface usage patterns (provider breakdown, pantry match rates, continent diversity) without manual CSV parsing. The existing CSV columns map cleanly to a Prisma model.
## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-13 18:11 → No pagination on recipe list; OG image generation blocks the request thread

`GET /recipes` returns all recipes for a user in a single query with no limit or cursor — as a user's recipe count grows this will become a memory and latency problem. `@napi-rs/canvas` OG image generation runs synchronously in the recipe-generate request handler: canvas creation, drawing, and PNG encoding block the Node.js event loop per recipe. `runInsightAnalysis` fetches up to 50 recipes and calls Ollama up to 5 times after each recipe generation; under concurrent load this compounds DB query and Ollama pressure. Append-only CSV log files (`RECIPE-METRIC.csv`, `DISCOVER-METRIC.csv`, `DIGEST-METRIC.csv`) have no rotation strategy and grow unboundedly on a long-running server.
## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-13 17:04 → MEMORY-METRIC.csv orphaned; cook records absent from digest; getRecipeUsage returns 0 on Redis failure

**1. MEMORY-METRIC.csv is orphaned.** `logs/MEMORY-METRIC.csv` appears in the git tree but no code in `src/` writes to it. It may be written by an external process under the `jayagent` account or is a leftover artifact. If external, it should be documented; if orphaned, it should be removed.

**2. Cook records not summarised in daily digest.** The `CookRecord` model (migration `20260531000000`) tracks STARTED/COMPLETED/ABANDONED cooking sessions. `src/digest.ts` does not read or report on cook records. Adding a daily completion rate (`COMPLETED / (COMPLETED + ABANDONED)`) to the digest would give visibility into a new engagement metric.

**3. `getRecipeUsage` returns zeroed quota on Redis failure.** `src/middleware/rateLimit.ts:40-57` returns `{used: 0, max: N, ttl: 0}` for both providers when Redis throws. This means `GET /recipes/usage` tells users they have full quota even if they've exhausted it, which could create UX confusion (generate button appears enabled, then hits a Redis-recovered 429).

**4. No retention policy on CSV metric files.** Log files grow indefinitely. On a Mac mini with limited SSD, `RECIPE-METRIC.csv` will accumulate all-time history. A cron rotation or line-count cap would prevent unbounded growth.
## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-09 18:16 â†’ digest.ts is the primary usage-review mechanism but its data queries and output format are invisible to this tracking system; Slack alerts are ad-hoc strings with no structured event taxonomy

**digest.ts as a black-box usage channel:**
- `src/digest.ts` is a separate process that generates periodic operational summaries, likely sent to Slack via `chatAlert()`. The data it queries (user counts, recipe counts, error rates), the aggregation window, and the output format are entirely undocumented. If the product owner's primary view into weekly usage is this digest, decisions are being made on an ad-hoc Slack message that has no retention, no searchability, and no versioned format.
- If digest is renamed, refactored, or crashes silently (no pm2 supervision), usage visibility disappears with no alert.

**chatAlert() event taxonomy is unstructured:**
- `chatAlert()` is called from multiple callsites (Apple auth failure, recipe generation error, likely digest summaries) with free-form message strings. There is no event taxonomy, no `event_type` field, and no Slack channel routing by severity or category. As call sites multiply, Slack becomes noisy without structured filtering. Automated alerting rules cannot be built on regex-matched free text.

**Historical usage irrecoverable after log rotation:**
- pm2 default log rotation discards logs after they reach a size threshold. Console request logs (`[req] METHOD PATH STATUS DURATIONms userId=X`) are the only persistent telemetry â€” once rotated, weekly active users, endpoint hit rates, and error rates for any previous time window are unrecoverable. No log export to a queryable sink (Datadog, Loki, CloudWatch) exists.

## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-09 18:03 â†’ Cook session funnel invisible; insight acceptance rate untracked; no per-provider cost attribution from DB; UserFlowView step-drop data collected but never queried

**Cook funnel not aggregated:**
- `CookRecord` stores STARTED/COMPLETED/ABANDONED per session, but no route or job computes aggregate funnel stats (startâ†’complete rate, avg session duration, most-abandoned recipes). The data is in DB but only accessible by raw SQL; there is no admin endpoint to surface it.

**Insight acceptance untracked:**
- `PATCH /insights/:id` accepts `action: "accept" | "dismiss"` but `UserInsight.acceptedAt` or a status field is not visible in the schema â€” it is unclear whether accept/dismiss is persisted at all, or just triggers some UI update. If insight acceptance is not stored, the ML feedback loop (which insights are useful) cannot be built.

**AI provider cost attribution gap:**
- `Recipe.provider` stores the AI provider per recipe. `CookRecord` links recipe to cook session. But there is no query that aggregates: "total recipes generated per provider per week per cohort." Cost-per-cohort analysis requires joining Recipe + User + CookRecord with a GROUP BY provider, which does not exist as an endpoint.

**UserFlowView step-drop data unused:**
- `UserFlowView.skippedSteps` (array) and `UserFlowView.responses` (JSON) are written on flow completion, but no admin or analytics endpoint queries them. Step-level drop-off rates (which onboarding step causes most users to skip) are derivable from this data but currently invisible.

**Request logs not persisted:**
- All HTTP request logs go to stdout only. pm2 rotates logs by default after a certain size. Historical usage trends (weekly active users, endpoint popularity, error rate over time) cannot be reconstructed once logs rotate.
## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-07 16:30 â†’ CookRecord data collected but no aggregation endpoint; insight trigger unknown; storeMetrics data only via admin route

**CookRecord analytics gap:**
- `CookRecord` now stores pantry vs. grocery ingredient breakdowns per cook session, but there is no aggregation endpoint to answer questions like "what % of ingredients users typically have in pantry" or "how often do cooks abandon vs. complete". The data is collected but not surfaced.

**Insight trigger opacity:**
- `runInsightAnalysis()` exists in `src/services/ai/insights.ts` but it is unclear from the codebase when/where it is triggered. If it is triggered only on recipe save, users with old recipe libraries will never receive insights. No scheduled job or batch runner is visible.

**Store metrics:**
- `GET /store-metrics` is behind requireAdmin â€” only accessible to admins. If the product team wants to see AppStore/PlayStore install counts, they need admin credentials. No read-only analytics role exists.

**Flow view tracking:**
- `UserFlowView` tracks flow completion, skipped steps, and JSON responses â€” useful data â€” but no admin endpoint exists to query aggregate flow completion rates or step drop-off.

**Continent/dietary data collected but unused in reporting:**
- `continentPreferences`, `dietaryTags`, `mealType` are stored per-recipe but only surfaced in the public profile endpoint. No internal dashboard or aggregate query exists.
## ISSUE:usage 2026-06-07 10:00 â†’ No analytics beyond console logs; recipe provider not tracked per-user in DB; UserFlowView written but never queried

**Analytics gap:**
- All request logging goes to console only: `[req] METHOD PATH STATUS DURATIONms userId=X`. No structured logging to a sink (e.g. Datadog, Loki, Seq). No way to query usage history after log rotation.
- `GET /stats` rounds all counts to nearest 10 for display â€” not useful for actual analytics. No admin dashboard endpoint that shows real counts.

**Recipe provider not persisted correctly:**
- `Recipe.provider` field exists in schema but it's unclear from routes whether the AI provider name (ollama/openai/claude) is consistently written on save. If missing, it's impossible to determine cost breakdown from DB alone.

**UserFlowView unused in queries:**
- `UserFlowView` table records onboarding flow completions, but no route returns aggregate completion rates. `GET /admin/flows` returns `_count: { views: true }` which gives total views but not completion vs. skip rates.

**Chat route undocumented:**
- `src/routes/chat.ts` exists but is not in README â€” unclear what it does or how it's used.

**YouTube integration:**
- `src/services/youtube.ts` is called per recipe generate â€” if it fails, it's unclear whether it's a blocking error or silent skip. No logging of how often video lookup succeeds.

**Action needed:** Add structured request logging. Consistently write `provider` on recipe save. Add analytics endpoints for admins. Document the chat route.

For a single `/recipe/:token` page load, `api.toifood.co.nz/recipes/public/${token}` is called by: (1) the Cloudflare Pages Function at request time for SSR meta injection, (2) the `toifood-og` Worker when the browser/crawler fetches the OG image, and (3) the React client on mount in `SharedRecipe.jsx`. All three calls are independent with no shared cache or coordination. The Pages Function and OG Worker use `cf: { cacheTtl: 300 }`, but the client-side fetch has no CDN caching, so each real user visit produces at minimum one uncached call to the origin.
